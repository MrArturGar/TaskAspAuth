# TestTaskAuth
The task is that it is necessary to create a one-page site with authorization that goes through a third-party API. It is necessary to display a notification about an error or a successful login.

The first step is validation of the data (models) on the client side, only then validation on the server side. Helps us with this jquery.validate.min.js.
